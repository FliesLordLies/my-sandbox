.page {
  @include border-box;
  @include reset;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column nowrap;
  height: 100%;
  justify-content: space-between; 
}
// "space-between" helps to keep the footer (which is the last child of this 
// block) pinned to the bottom of the page. However, to make this gimmick work,
// html, body, and *this* node must have height equal to 100%.
